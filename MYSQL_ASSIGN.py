'''Q1'''
'''A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient storage,
 retrieval, and manipulation of data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of information, making it 
 easier for applications to access and interact with the data they need. Databases are essential components of various 
 software systems, ranging from small applications to large-scale enterprise systems.
Different types of databases exist, but two prominent categories are SQL databases and NoSQL databases. Let's explore 
the differences between them:

1. SQL Databases:
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL databases are relational databases that use a schema to define the structure
of data and the relationships between different data elements. In an SQL database, data is stored in tables, and each 
table contains rows and columns.

Key characteristics of SQL databases:
- Fixed Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that specifies the structure of the data, including data types, 
constraints, and relationships between tables.
- ACID properties: They support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data 
integrity and reliability.
- Standard Query Language: SQL databases use SQL for data manipulation and querying.
- Vertical Scalability: Scaling SQL databases often involves upgrading hardware (e.g., increasing CPU, RAM, or 
storage capacity).

Popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

2. NoSQL Databases:
NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible way of 
storing and retrieving data without adhering to a fixed schema. They are designed to handle large volumes of data with 
varying structures, making them suitable for modern web applications and big data use cases.

Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:
- Dynamic Schema: NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema, allowing developers to store different types of data 
in the same database.
- Horizontal Scalability: NoSQL databases are built to scale horizontally, meaning they can distribute data across 
multiple servers to handle increased loads.
- No Joins: NoSQL databases typically do not support complex joins as relational databases do. Instead, they often 
encourage data denormalization and duplication for better performance.
- Eventual Consistency: NoSQL databases may sacrifice strong consistency in favor of high availability and partition 
tolerance in distributed systems. This means data may not be immediately consistent across all nodes.

There are different types of NoSQL databases, including:
- Document stores (e.g., MongoDB): Store data in JSON-like documents.
- Key-value stores (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB): Store data as key-value pairs.
- Column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra): Organize data into columns, similar to tables but without a fixed schema.
- Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j): Focus on the relationships between data entities.

Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, the nature of 
the data, the scalability needs, and the development team's familiarity with each type. Each database type has its 
strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be based on the project's needs and goals.'''

'''Q2'''
'''DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and 
manage the structure of a database and its objects. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database 
objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. Unlike Data Manipulation Language (DML), which deals with data 
manipulation (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), DDL focuses on defining the database structure itself.
Let's explore the common DDL statements and their purposes with examples:
1. CREATE:
The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. Here's an example of
 creating a table named "Employees" with columns for employee information:'''


CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Department VARCHAR(100)
);
'''
In this example, we create a table named "Employees" with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, and Department.

2. DROP:
The DROP statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. Be careful when 
using the DROP statement, as it permanently deletes the object and its data. Here's an example of dropping the 
previously created "Employees" table:
'''
DROP TABLE Employees;

'''After executing this statement, the "Employees" table and all its data will be removed from the database.

3. ALTER:
The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. You can use ALTER to add, 
modify, or delete columns in a table or change other object properties. Here's an example of adding a new column 
"Email" to the "Employees" table:
'''

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);


'''After executing this statement, the "Employees" table will have an additional "Email" column.

4. TRUNCATE:
The TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly delete all the rows from a table while retaining the table structure. 
Unlike the DELETE statement, which removes rows one by one, TRUNCATE empties the entire table at once, which makes 
it faster. However, TRUNCATE cannot be used with tables that are referenced by foreign key constraints.

Example of using TRUNCATE:

'''
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```

'''After executing this statement, all rows in the "Employees" table will be removed, but the table structure will 
remain intact.

In summary, DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are crucial for defining the database's structure and 
managing its objects. They allow you to create new objects, modify existing ones, and remove unwanted objects, 
helping you maintain a well-organized and efficient database system.'''

'''Q3'''
'''DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with the 
data stored in a database. DML statements allow you to insert, update, retrieve, and delete data from database tables. 
Unlike DDL (Data Definition Language), which focuses on defining the database structure, DML focuses on data manipulation
within the existing database structure.
Let's explore the common DML statements, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and provide examples for each:
1. INSERT:
The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. You use the INSERT statement when you want to add 
new records to the database. Here's an example of how to insert a new employee record into the "Employees" table:'''

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 30, 'Sales');

'''In this example, we insert a new employee with EmployeeID 1, FirstName "John", LastName "Doe", Age 30, and 
Department "Sales" into the "Employees" table.
2. UPDATE:
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. You use the UPDATE statement when you want to 
change the values of one or more columns in existing records. Here's an example of how to update the department for 
an employee with EmployeeID 1:

UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Marketing'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;'''

'''In this example, we update the Department to "Marketing" for the employee with EmployeeID 1 in the "Employees" table.

3. DELETE:
The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. You use the DELETE statement when you want to 
remove specific records from the database. Here's an example of how to delete an employee with EmployeeID 1 from the ' 
"Employees" table'''

DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

'''In this example, we delete the employee with EmployeeID 1 from the "Employees" table.
It's important to use DML statements with caution, especially when using UPDATE and DELETE, as they can modify 
or remove data permanently. Always ensure you have proper filters in the WHERE clause to target the specific rows 
you want to update or delete. Additionally, consider creating backups or using transactions when making significant 
changes to the data to prevent accidental data loss.'''

'''Q4'''
'''DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data 
from a database. DQL statements allow you to query and retrieve specific information from database tables based 
on certain conditions. The most common DQL statement is the SELECT statement.
The SELECT statement is used to fetch data from one or more tables in the database. It allows you to specify 
the columns you want to retrieve, the table you want to query, and any conditions that must be met for the data to 
be included in the result set.
Here's the basic syntax of the SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Let's explain the parts of the SELECT statement with an example:
Suppose we have a table called "Customers" with the following structure:
| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Age | Email              |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----|--------------------|
| 1          | John      | Doe      | 30  | john.doe@example.com|
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | 28  | jane.smith@example.com|
| 3          | Michael   | Johnson  | 35  | michael.j@example.com|

Example 1: Retrieve all columns from the "Customers" table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customers;
```

The result of this query will be:

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Age | Email              |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----|--------------------|
| 1          | John      | Doe      | 30  | john.doe@example.com|
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | 28  | jane.smith@example.com|
| 3          | Michael   | Johnson  | 35  | michael.j@example.com|

Example 2: Retrieve specific columns (FirstName and LastName) from the "Customers" table.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Customers;
```

The result of this query will be:

| FirstName | LastName |
|-----------|----------|
| John      | Doe      |
| Jane      | Smith    |
| Michael   | Johnson  |

Example 3: Retrieve customers with an age greater than 30.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Age > 30;
```

The result of this query will be:

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Age | Email              |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----|--------------------|
| 3          | Michael   | Johnson  | 35  | michael.j@example.com|

In this example, we used the SELECT statement to fetch data from the "Customers" table. We can specify the columns 
we want to retrieve, filter the rows based on certain conditions using the WHERE clause, and obtain the desired 
information from the database. SELECT statements are fundamental for querying databases and extracting the 
required data for various applications and analyses.'''

'''Q5'''
'''Primary Key and Foreign Key are two essential concepts in relational databases that establish relationships
 between tables and ensure data integrity and consistency.

1. Primary Key:
A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a database table. It is used to uniquely identify 
each row, making it a crucial attribute for ensuring data integrity. Every table in a relational database should
 have a primary key. The primary key enforces the following properties:

- Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique; no two rows in the table can have the same 
primary key value.
- Non-null: The primary key column cannot contain null values; it must have a value for every row.

Example of a primary key in a "Students" table:

| StudentID | FirstName | LastName | Age |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|
| 1         | John       | Doe        | 20  |
| 2         | Jane       | Smith      | 22  |

In this example, the "StudentID" column serves as the primary key. It uniquely identifies each student in the table.

2. Foreign Key:
A Foreign Key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a 
relationship between two tables, known as a parent-child relationship. The foreign key represents the values from 
the primary key column of the related table. Foreign keys help maintain referential integrity, ensuring that the 
data in the child table remains consistent with the data in the parent table.

Example of a foreign key in an "Enrollments" table:

| EnrollmentID | StudentID (Foreign Key) | Course      |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 1            | 1                        | Math         |
| 2            | 2                        | Science      |

In this example, the "StudentID" column in the "Enrollments" table is a foreign key that refers to the primary 
key "StudentID" in the "Students" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, where each 
enrollment in the "Enrollments" table corresponds to a unique student in the "Students" table.

Foreign keys provide several important features:

- Referential Integrity: Foreign keys ensure that the data in the child table (e.g., "Enrollments") corresponds to 
valid data in the parent table (e.g., "Students"). This prevents orphaned or inconsistent data.
- Joins: Foreign keys allow tables to be connected through queries using JOIN operations, enabling the retrieval of 
related information from multiple tables.
In summary, Primary Keys uniquely identify records within a table, while Foreign Keys establish relationships 
between tables and maintain referential integrity, ensuring the consistency and reliability of the data in the database.'''


'''Q6'''
'''To connect MySQL to Python, you'll need to use a MySQL connector library. In this example, I'll use the `mysql-connector-python` library, which is a pure Python MySQL client. Make sure you have installed the library using `pip install mysql-connector-python`.

Here's a Python code example to connect to MySQL and execute a simple query:

```python'''

import mysql.connector
# MySQL database configuration
db_config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'database': 'your_database_name'
}
try:
    # Connect to the database
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)

    # Create a cursor object to interact with the database
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Example query: Create a new table
    create_table_query = '''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example_table (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50),
        age INT
    )
    '''
    # Execute the query using the cursor
    cursor.execute(create_table_query)
    # Commit the changes to the database (if necessary)
    connection.commit()
    print("Table created successfully!")
except mysql.connector.Error as error:
    print("Error while connecting to the MySQL database:", error)

finally:
    # Close the cursor and the database connection
    if 'connection' in locals():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

'''Explanation of `cursor()` and `execute()` methods:
1. `cursor()`: The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object that allows you to interact with 
the MySQL database. The cursor object is like a pointer or a handle to the result set of a query. It 
enables you to execute SQL statements and fetch data from the database.

2. `execute(query, params=None)`: The `execute()` method is used to execute an SQL query or command. 
It takes an SQL query as its argument and optional parameters (if the query requires any). The query is 
executed using the cursor object created earlier. If the query has placeholders (usually represented by 
`%s` in the query), you can pass the values for those placeholders through the `params` parameter as a tuple.

In the example above, we used the `execute()` method to execute the `create_table_query`. This query creates a new 
table in the MySQL database if it doesn't already exist. After calling `execute()`, the changes are made to the 
database by calling `connection.commit()`, which confirms the transaction. Finally, we close the cursor and the 
database connection using the `close()` method.
Remember to replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database_name'` with your actual MySQL 
database credentials and desired database name.'''

'''Q7'''
'''In an SQL query, the clauses are typically executed in the following order:
1. **FROM**: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which the data will be retrieved.
2. **JOIN**: If there are any JOIN clauses, they are executed after the FROM clause to combine data from multiple 
tables based on specified conditions.
3. **WHERE**: The WHERE clause filters the rows from the tables based on the specified conditions. It is executed
 after the FROM and JOIN clauses.
4. **GROUP BY**: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the result set by one or more columns. It is executed after 
the WHERE clause.
5. **HAVING**: The HAVING clause filters the grouped data based on specified conditions. It is applied after 
the GROUP BY clause.
6. **SELECT**: The SELECT clause selects the specific columns to be included in the result set. It is applied
 after the previous clauses have been executed.
7. **DISTINCT**: If the DISTINCT keyword is used in the SELECT clause, it is applied to eliminate duplicate 
rows from the result set after the SELECT clause is executed.
8. **ORDER BY**: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns. It is 
executed after all the previous clauses have been applied.
9. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: If the LIMIT and OFFSET keywords are used to restrict the number of rows returned 
or to skip a certain number of rows, they are applied after all the previous clauses have been executed.
It's important to note that not all queries will include all of these clauses, and their order may vary 
depending on the specific SQL query you're constructing. Also, some database engines might have slight 
variations in their execution order, but the overall logic remains the same.'''
